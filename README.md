# OBDII_Code_Finder
OBDII Code Finder is quite a useful tool when you're trying to find some information and don't know where to start. Currently I have a database with both the code numbers and the code titles. Obviously this isn't enough to figure out whats going on with you're vehicle. This program also searches through a website with a description of the problem, possible symptoms, if the severity is available, let the user know how dangerous the problem is, and list possible fixes to that code. While currently running on a Command Line Interface I will be working on a Graphical User Interface after I finish the vehicle search feature.
